My first project in AI/ML! Hii Everyone I am diving deep into AI and ML. This project on Multi Class Animal Classification is created on jupyter notebook. I gained valuable experiences into the various Python Libraries. I gained hands-on Python libraries including: -> Numpy -> Matplotlib -> TensorFlow and its Keras API. The dataset was gathered from Kaggle which helped me in the project. At the last I used the Pyplot module of the Matplotlib Library to plot the images and show them on the screen.
